> - PARA is a personal organization system developed by Tiago Forte. It stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. 


1. **Projects**: These are specific, time-bound objectives that require action and planning. They are typically short-term and have defined outcomes.

2. **Areas**: Areas represent broader areas of responsibility or focus in your life. They encompass ongoing, *long-term aspects like health, career, hobbies, mom, dad, friends, etc.* 

3. **Resources**: Resources are references, tools, or information that support your projects and areas. This category includes documents, books, websites, or anything you need for your work or personal life.
	1. *or anything you are interested in and want to document and keep track of.*

5. **Archives**: Archives are where you store completed projects and reference materials that you might need in the future. They keep your current workspace clutter-free.
	1. don't neglect your Archive, *before you start or end new projects*, reference your archive.

PARA is designed to help individuals manage their tasks, responsibilities, and information efficiently by categorizing everything into these four distinct categories, enabling better organization and productivity.

[Brief Summary of PARA by the Creator (Tiago Forte)](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)

- the tool you use *does not matter*
	- everything beyond the tool is really a convenience, or a speed perk.
	- but never necessary to "use one tool over another"
		- *huge rabbit hole for beginners*


# Why I (Diego) use PARA to organize my "Second Brain"
---
being able to have the piece of mind that a thought you had, video, idea, or reminder can be written done and tucked away so that you can focus on the moment and *come back to it later*. 

having structure and rigidity to a structure allows you to save the time of critique and being able to lean into the work instead of constantly changing aspects. 

if you want the full process or methodology; read this book:
