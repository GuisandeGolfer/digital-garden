Will need to create a data model / template for OpenAI and have methods in the api that run my script, fill the information into the OpenAI response model, and maybe reference database values; and then send that response back to the custom GPT.

I might not need to even make a call to OpenAI but just send back the transcription for ChatGPT to use, so they can have "conversations" with the youtube content.

maybe make that a feature for the youtube to AI summary website later down the line.
