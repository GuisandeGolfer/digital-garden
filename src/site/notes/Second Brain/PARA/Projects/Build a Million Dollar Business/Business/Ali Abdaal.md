1. Tip 5: **Invest in Yourself First** 
	1. it's great to invest, because you are trying to get more out of it than you put in
	2. but you should *invest in yourself first*  because that will pay you way more than 7% - 10% per year. 
		1. invest in your skills, and your ability to make money.
	3. Ask myself: "*What can I invest in for myself to improve my ability to make money*"
2. Tip 4: **Work for a Startup**
	1. join a start up that is small if you want to start your own business
	2. you'll learn more about creating and managing your own business.
3. Tip 3: **Take the 3rd Door**
	1. life is like a night club, there are three doors to any nightclub
		1. the front where everyone waits and it takes forever
		2. the backdoor: where the billionaires and actors get in
		3. then the *third* door: the one that you have to hustle for; through the window, into the kitchen, bride the guard, and eventually make your way inside
		4. **most really successful people always take the third door. 
4. Tip 2: Everything is downhill from lead generation
	1. [Notion page discussing this topic ](https://www.notion.so/The-CASTLE-Method-2029cdb262bc4d80976a32fab802086d?pvs=4)
	2. loads of people will come to free events, or products -> and a percentage of them *will be interested in your actual paid product*
	3. generate score card MVP
		1. make a quiz or something that gets market data alongside giving someone what they are looking for
			1. **"Free quiz to find out the best AI tool for your business"
			2. ask questions to narrow down results
			3. keep question data for better feedback and **product-market fit**
	4. ask social media
	5. **before you make product -> validate with leads**
5. Tip 1: Extraordinary results == extraordinary inputs
	1. if you go hard => results will seem to come easy
	2. magic  is -> *spending more time on something than anyone else might reasonably expect*
	3. **What do you put in an extraordinary amount of time doing (that most people might not reasonably expect) ... but you enjoy the process as well?**

**from current timestamp: 26:10**

freelancing is not the best = selling your own labor
entrepreneur => focus on outcomes instead of component labor

*find the components (people) that can specialize in the work and organize them to quickly get your client's desired outcome.*

if freelancing => *50% of the time* you are just trying to get your next customer

and a lot of downsides of not working at a company without the upside.

**think more like**: 
	=> what is the problem I am trying to solve for other people? (instead of just trying to solve your problems...)
	how can I organize and run a business to efficiently solve that problem.

### Mindset Shifts

shift your mindset towards money -> *$3K is not a lot of money* 

- never read the news (it's always going to be irrelevant)
-  <u>everything is downstream from lead generation.</u>

---
- started as a RevShare model like mentioned in [[Second Brain/PARA/Resources/Readwise/Books/$100M Offers\|$100M Offers]]
- *should you start a startup or join someone else's*
	> join someone else's

- do two years in someone else's startup / agency first, then start your own. 
- learning how everything works is so much better than getting funneled into an organization
- revShare example:
	> customer pays for costs of service, but you get a percentage of the success profits  

> would use low-risk first step (free lead magnet) to draw leads that would be interested.
- like onlinebusinessbuilder, etc.
- would charge a combination of *success fees* based on leads and sales. 

> "you need to grind"
- success can happen quickly if you tap into a trend and the flood gates could open.

- some businesses compound over time. "j-curve businesses"
	- technology
	- restaurants
- their cashflow over time looks like a J
- technology companies are a good example: spend 1 million for a software product, and charge $10 / month per user.

	> as you get more and more customers your cashflow will start exponentially growing.

- consulting - non j-curve
- low startup costs but exponential cashflow potential.

- j-curve businesses have frictionless sales process
- non-j-curve businesses require a sales process.

## Step 1

Discover your Passion
- find a skill that you enjoy or a process in which you enjoy (for the most part) all the components
- **if I had 100M in the bank, How would I choose to spend my time**
- Skill vetting
	- what generates energy instead of taking energy
	- what do I have an aptitude for
	- and what do I enjoy doing. 
- Skill and Validate the Market
	- make sure that when you are thinking of these skills, think in terms of helping other people solve problems
	- [Castle Method & Validate with quiz](https://youtu.be/bXLZ8I7s8tw?si=V8c-yf5o4YqQMLC9)

## Step 2

Generate Leads
*decide on a business model*
1. Service
2. Product
3. Content -> post free content and get money through advertisers etc. (like TV) 

> If I had to create a service, product or content around this skill, what would it be?

## Step 3
build an MVP

what is the minimum viable product that you can build that gets your service/product/content in front of people and where you can get feedback?

if there isn't a market, or problem, or need for your service/product/content then it's just a hobby.

there needs to be a starving audience that can pay you.

## Step 4
scale sustainably and work-life balance

## Step 5
periodically re-evaluate and pivot

periodically ask: **"Is the thing you're currently doing actually the thing you want to be doing?"**

### Common Mistakes

1. neglecting market validation
	1. need to focus on *product-market fit*
2. scaling too fast too soon
3. forgetting work-life balance
	1. enjoy life
