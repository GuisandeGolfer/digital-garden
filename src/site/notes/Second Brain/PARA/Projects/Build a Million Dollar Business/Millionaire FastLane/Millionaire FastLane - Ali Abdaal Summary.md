The process to travel the fast lane is to create "money trees" 

There are different types of money trees, these money trees are business systems that can grow without your direct supervision and can scale. 

### The 4 Systems
---

>[!network] Rental System

a good example would be real estate, or licensing like music licensing

>[!network] Distribution System

amazon is one of the largest distribution systems in the world

a place that connects buyers and sellers

>[!network] Software System 

SaaS
or Digital Assets that have no cost of distribution or supply

>[!network] Content System

- books
- blogs
- youtube
- courses
- newsletters
- etc.

The best way to start building these money trees (which are hard to make) is to **switch from a consumer to a producer**

switch your mindset and act on it, no matter the previous failures. [[Second Brain/PARA/Projects/Build a Million Dollar Business/MDW Journal/MDW Journal\|MDW Journal]]

### Commitment vs Interest
---
>[!activity] You need to go above & beyond and be single-minded when building your money trees,
>go beyond where other people would stop, keep pushing and be unbreak-able.
