There are 4 segments:

1. **Controllable Unlimited Leverage (CUL)
	1. Slowlane is defined by uncontrollable variables with no leverage, the fastlane exploits the opposite conditions: maximum control and leverage
2. **Business
	1. your own business, self-employment, entrepreneurship are centrist to the Fastlane, much like a job is to the Slowlane.
3. **Lifestyle
	1. The Fastlane is a lifestyle choice:
		1. a commitment of blended beliefs, processes, and actions
4. **Rapid Wealth creation
	1. The Fastlane is about creating large sums of wealth asymmetrically and beyond the confines of the "middle class". FastLane asymmetry is when a $1000 investment in a business venture transforms into $10M several years later.

## The FastLane MindPosts
---

**Debt Perception**: *Debt is useful if it allows me to build and grow my system*

**Time Perception**: *Time is the most important asset I have, far exceeding money*

**Education Perception**: *The moment you stop learning is the moment you stop growing. Constant expansion of knowledge and awareness is critical to my journey*

**Money Perception**: *Money is everywhere, and it's extremely abundant. Money reflects how many lives I've touched. Money reflects the value I've created*

**Primary Income Source**: *I earn income via my business systems and investments*

**Primary Wealth Accelerator**: *I make something from nothing. I give birth to assets and make them valuable to the marketplace. Other times, I take existing assets and add value to them*

**Wealth Perception**: *Build business systems for cash flow and asset valuation*

**Wealth Equation**: *Wealth = Net Profit + Asset Value*

**Strategy**: *The more I help, the richer I become in time, money, and personal fulfillment*

**Destination**: *Lifetime passive income, either through business or investments*

**Responsibility & Accountability**: *Life is what I make it. My financial plan is my responsibility, and I choose how I react to my circumstances*

**Life Perception**: *My dreams are worth pursuing, no matter how outlandish, and I understand it will take time and money to make those dreams real.*
