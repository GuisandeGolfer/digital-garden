	2. Social Media
		1. instagram
		2. facebook
		3. twitter
		4. linkedin
	3. Phone Contacts 
2. *Pick a platform*
	1. start with the one you have the most people on
3. *personalize your message*
	1. reach out

		2. "Hey, hey saw you had a baby " etc.
4. Reach out to 100 people a day
5. *warm them up*
	1. ACA
		1. acknowledge something about them
		2. compliment it
		3. ask a question related to them that will lead into the service that you are selling.
6. *invite their friends*
	1. don't sell them
	2. "btw do you know anyone who is looking for **XYZ**"
		1. "because I am opening a few slots to help people do that."
7. *make it free*
	1. but with three obligations
		1. you actually use my service
		2. you give me good feedback on it.
		3. you leave a killer review, if you think I deserve one.
	2. still need to do a really good job because even though it's "free" doesn't mean the value should be bad.
8. *Conversation Scripts*
	1. Script 1 
		2. "Do you know anybody who is (Describe their struggles) looking to (Dream outcome) in (time delay)?"
		3.  "I am taking on 5 case studies for free because that's all I can handle."
		4. "I just want to get some testimonials for my service or product"
	5. Script 2
		1. "I have a customer named (XXX) work with me to get (dream outcome) even through she (describe struggle)"
		2. I would like to get more testimonials to show it worked across different scenarios.
		3. Does anyone you like come to mind?
			3. Does anyone you hate come to mind?
	6. Script 3 *straight to the point*  [[Second Brain/PARA/Resources/Readwise/Books/$100M Offers\|$100M Offers]]
		1. I helped (type of customer) get (dream outcome) in (time period) without effort and sacrifice and I guarantee (XYZ) to decrease risk
7. *if someone won't work with you even if it's free*
	1. there are must be hidden costs of the thing you are offering.
	2. if you can eliminate those while working for free, you can be that much more valuable compared to the guys that still charge people but have those hidden costs
8. *start back at the top of the list*
	1. and try again if you don't have 5 customers, but most likely you will
9. *Start charging*
	1. once people give you referrals, then you know you are good enough to start charging.
	2. go back to the original Script 1 and ask
		1. "I am taking on 5 case studies for *80% off*  because that's all I can handle"
		2. after 5 more customers, change that number to *60% off* and so forth till you hit your customer limit.
10. *Cherish your free customers* and make sure you respect them just as much as the paying customers who came later.
11. *Keep your customer lead list warm*
	1. keep checking in like a friend
	2. post more testimonials, interm stuff, and customer success.
		1. eventually your audience will solicit you
