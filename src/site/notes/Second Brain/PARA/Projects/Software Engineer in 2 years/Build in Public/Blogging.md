> [!globe] Blog Working Philosophy
 >Working on your own projects helps you build specific knowledge, they're what compound knowledge into skill, skill which can't be taught in courses.
> 
> What should you work on?
> 
> The hard part is you've unlimited options. The best part is you've got unlimited options.
> 
> **One method is to find the ideal company and ideal role you're going for. And then do your research.**
> 
> What does a person in that position day-to-day? Figure it out and then replicate it. *Design yourself a 6-week project based on what you find.*
> 
> Why 6-weeks? The worst case is, if it doesn't work out, it's only 6 weeks. The best case is, you'll surprise yourself at what you can accomplish in 42-days.
> 
> If you're still stuck, follow your interests. Use the same timeline except this time, choose something which excites you and see where it goes. *Remember, the worst case is, after 6-weeks, you'll know whether to pursue it (another 6 weeks) or move onto the next thing.*
> 
> Now instead of only having a collection of certificates, you've got a story to tell. You've got evidence of you trying to put what you've learned into practice (exactly what you'll be doing in a job).
> 
> And if you're wondering where the evidence comes from, it comes from you documenting your work.
> 
> Where?
> 
> On your own blog.
> 
> Why a blog?
> 
> We've discussed this before but it's worth repeating. Writing down what you're working on, helps solidify your thinking. It also helps others learn what youâ€™ve figured out.
> 
**You could start with a post per week detailing how your 6-week project is going**, what you've figured out, what you're doing next. Again, your project doesn't have to be perfect, none are, and your writing doesn't have to be perfect either.

> [!trees] Post Overall Structure
> What are you working on this week? Write it down, share it with the team. This not only consolidates your thinking, it gives your team an opportunity to ask questions and offer advice.
> 
> Set a reminder for the end of each day. Have it ask, "What did you work on today?". Your response doesn't have to be long but it should be written down.
> 
> You could use the following **template**.
> 
> - What I worked on today (1-3 points on what you did):
> 
> What's working?
> - What's not working?
> - What could be improved?
> - What I'm working on next:
> 
> - What's your next course of action? (based on the above)
> - Why?
> - What's holding you back?

- [x] ! First blog post: ML roadmap and plan that I have in obsidian. and everything I have been doing to prep and organizing for [[Second Brain/PARA/Projects/Software Engineer in 2 years/Complete AI & DS Mastery/Daniel Bourke ML Roadmap/Daniel Bourke ML Roadmap\| this]]  endevour.
	
- [x] ! Make a blog series about building the infamous beats project
	- each blog post doesn't need to about the progress of the project but mostly the concepts that I am learning, explaining them in the blog post (what people are looking for)
	- and then add a couple excerpts to the beginning and the end of the blog post

- @ Started the blog post series for the infamous beats project but I think I want to start doing *a blog post a week on each topic*
	- ML Bootcamp
	- Projects I am working on
	- Google Certificate

- @ Make a blog series about the Google IT Automation Certificate and the topics I am learning

- post on twitter, instagram, and blog post. 

- if I learn enough about other topics while learning; 
	- write blog posts from my notes inside of Obsidian 
	- and once I get a workflow and a template going, start creating blog posts with the other content and resources inside of **Obsidian****.
