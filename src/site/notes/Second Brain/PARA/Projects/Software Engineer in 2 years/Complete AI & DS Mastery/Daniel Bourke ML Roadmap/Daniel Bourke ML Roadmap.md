- @ After catching myself with Python, AKA finish python programmer google cert.

- $ Learn Machine Learning / Deep Learning Fundamentals - in PUBLIC.

- @ You don't need another course (after learning skills). Start applying ML concepts through building real-impact projects in PUBLIC: best way to learn
	- need to "go off the happy path" so you can learn the highly valuable specific knowledge that comes from hours of troubleshooting, data mining, and stack exchange
	- and sharing your experiences in public is going to be the way to really learn and increase your communication skills and ML expertise.
	- Acquire through personal experimentation and public-sharing

- % Be Proactive and start performing the job you want before you get the job - in PUBLIC
	- submit pull requests for the company codebase that you want to work at.
		- when submitting pull requests look at their documentation or use [Ivy ML Library ](https://github.com/unifyai/unify) as a template
	- build projects and reach out to companies that could use them and give it to them and have them check it out. 
	- look at a cool job and try emulate the job in real life compared to the Job Description.

	- $ Idea: Take something you are passionate about, apply machine learning to the topic. Share it in public
	
  - @ Polish your ML Resume 
  - having code, demo, or blog posts on your resume is more impactful than courses

review of all my machine learning resources that is inside Google Chrome.
organize into a separate folder in obsidian and re-work my [[Second Brain/PARA/Projects/Software Engineer in 2 years/Software Engineer in 2 years\|Software Engineer in 2 years]] folder to be a more accurate
representation of my focus and what I want to start doing.

this video is going to be my new over-arching roadmap for learning, and anything that is MOOC related and is not beginner ML; is going to be put on the back-burner.
