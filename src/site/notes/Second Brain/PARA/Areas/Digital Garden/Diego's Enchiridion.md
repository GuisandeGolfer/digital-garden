# Welcome!

This is the start of my process of publishing my notes to the internet. 

Back in 2019, I starting teaching myself how to code. That commitment lead me to start taking digital notes on my iPad, which graduated to finding a better digital notes tool. 

Too much YouTube lead me to learn about [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and the all powerful [Tiago Forte]() and the [[Second Brain/PARA/Resources/Guides/Personal Knowledge Management 101\|PARA method.]]

You can explore the site through the search bar or the file tree on left, or you can visually explore using the graph at the bottom/or right of the page.

I will updating this homepage to have a view into my recently added or modified notes, and resources to learn more about me. 

Thank you!
